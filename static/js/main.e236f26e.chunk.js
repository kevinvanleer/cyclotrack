And finally, I wanted a record of my past rides so I could track progress toward my goals and compare with past performance.",Object(u.jsx)(y.c,{height:"1em"}),"As I developed and tested Cyclotrack, the shortcomings of smartphone GPS became apparent. The relatively low speed of cycling (compared to driving), shaded bike paths, buildings, and even cloudy days seemed to make tracking speed frustrating and unreliable. As a result I added support for Bluetooth Low Engery (BLE) heart rate, speed, and cadence sensors. This added a new level of fidelity to the data available to Cyclotrack, providing a much more reliable source for speed data and adding the ability to track pedaling cadence. Tracking heart rate provided a missing piece of information crucial to understanding how much effort I was expending on my rides. Over time, I was able to identify my optimal heart rate for pushing myself without burning out.",Object(u.jsx)(y.c,{height:"1em"}),"I wanted to have rich data analysis without relying on cloud services or third-party integrations with platforms like Strava or Google Fit, so Cyclotrack provides detailed ride analysis with, maps, graphs, and stats for each ride.

Cyclotrack is fully functional offline, no network connection is required to utilize any of its features. Your data is safe.

This integration enables Cyclotrack to send data to Google Fit so that my rides contribute to my heart points, calories, miles, and active minutes. Cyclotrack rides also appear in the Google Fit journal. There was another reason I wanted this integration. Until this point I had been entering my weight in Google Fit for a historical record, and Cyclotrack so that my weight could be used to help estimate calorie burn on my rides. I updated Cyclotrack to read all relevant (and available) biometric data from Google Fit. Cyclotrack reads height, weight, and resting heart rate data from Google Fit. It uses this information, along with BLE heart rate data (if available), to estimate calorie burn. The best part is that this feature is totally optional.
