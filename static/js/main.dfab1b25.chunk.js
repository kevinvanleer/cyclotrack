I also wanted to build an app that was functional using only onboard sensors, primarily GPS. And finally, I wanted a record of my past rides so I could track progress toward my goals and compare performance to past rides.",Object(i.jsx)(y.c,{height:"1em"}),"As I developed Cyclotrack, the shortcomings of smartphone GPS became apparent. The relatively low speed of cycling, shaded bike paths, buildings and even cloudy days seemed to make tracking instantaneous speed frustrating and unreliable. As a result I added support for Bluetooth Low Engery (BLE) heart rate, speed and cadence sensors. This added a new level of fidelity to the data available Cyclotrack, providing a much more reliable source for speed data and adding the ability to track pedaling cadence. Tracking heart rate provided a missing piece of information that helped me understand how much effort I was expending on my rides, when I was overdoing it, when I had more to give, and enabled me to push myself and keep my heart rate just under my functional threshold.",Object(i.jsx)(y.c,{height:"1em"}),"I wanted to have rich data analysis without relying on cloud storage or third part integrations with platforms like Strava or Google Fit, so Cyclotrack provides details analysis with, maps, graphs and stats for each ride. This data is stored efficiently on your device, and can be exported to XLSX format so you can do your own analysis in your favorite spreadsheet application. Cyclotrack is fully functional offline, no network connection is required to utilize any of its features. Your data is safe. I do not collect any data or analytics (although I may collect anonymous app usage data in the future) and I do not send or sell any data to third parties.",Object(i.jsx)(y.c,{height:"1em"}),"Having said all that, I wanted to track all my fitness activity in a single experience, so I built an integration between Cyclotrack and Google Fit. This integration enables Cyclotrack to send data to Google Fit so that I get credit for heart points. calories, miles, and minutes. Cyclotrack rides also appear in the Google Fit journal. There was another reason I wanted this integration. I wanted to track my weight in one place. Until this point I had been entering my weight in Google Fit to track my weight, and Cyclotrack so that my weight could be used to help estimate calorie burn on my rides. So I updated Cyclotrack to read all relevant (and available) biometric data from Google Fit. Cyclotrack can get height, weight, and resting heart rate data from Google Fit. It uses this information, and BLE heart rate (if available), to estimate calorie burn. The best part is that this feature is totally optional.
